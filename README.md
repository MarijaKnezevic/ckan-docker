This repository provides [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan) Docker images for the
[`sddi-ckan-k8s`](https://github.com/tum-gis/sddi-ckan-k8s) Helm chart.
The images contain CKAN itself compiled with a set of CKAN extension to add functionality required for
the SDDI concept and beyond that.
All images are available form `ghcr.io/tum-gis` Github container registry.
See [packages](https://github.com/orgs/tum-gis/packages?repo_name=ckan-docker) for all image flavors and tags.

## :inbox_tray: Image flavor overview

The CKAN-SDDI Docker images are released in three flavors, that are described below.
For each flavor a one [package](https://github.com/orgs/tum-gis/packages?repo_name=ckan-docker)
exists in this repository, where the image can be pulled.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-base
docker pull ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi
docker pull ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-social

```

### `sddi-base`

CKAN base image with a minimal set of extensions required for SDDI.
Default SDDI groups and topics are preinstalled.
This image is used as base image for the other images. If you plan to extend the SDDI images,
use this as base image.

```text
ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-base
```

### `sddi`

`sddi-base` + commonly used CKAN extensions for e.g. extended data format and preview support.
This is the image most people will usually want.

```text
ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi
```

### `sddi-social`

`sddi` + optional CKAN extension for social media features, that may require staff
for moderation of social media content.

```text
ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-social
```

## :1234: Image versioning

The images in this repo are versioned and tagged according to the
[releases](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckan-docker/releases) of this repository.
The `latest` tag points to the latest release number. The `edge` version is built from the
latest commit to the `main` branch of this repo.
The CKAN and CKAN extension versions used for each image are listed in the table below.

For development and debugging we provide a *debug* version for each image version.
These images are indicated by the `-debug` suffix on the image tag, e.g. `latest-debug` or `0.0.6-debug`.
The debug images have the FLASK debug toolbar enabled and all required debugging dependencies installed.
Read more on CKAN's debug mode in the
[official docs](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#debug).

> **Warning**: The debug image versions should not be used in a production environment!
> With debug mode enabled, a visitor to your site could execute malicious commands.

All available tags are listed in the packages of each image:

- [`sddi-base`](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckan-docker/pkgs/container/ckan-sddi-base)
- [`sddi`](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckan-docker/pkgs/container/ckan-sddi)
- [`sddi-social`](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckan-docker/pkgs/container/ckan-sddi-social)

### CKAN and CKAN extension versions

CKAN version: `2.9.7`
CKAN base image: `ghcr.io/keitaroinc/ckan:2.9.7-focal`

The CKAN catalog platform uses several extensions to provide the functionality needed for the SDDI concept.
The table below lists the included extensions with the currently used version.
Depending of the version of the upstream repository of the individual extensions,
the version refers either to a *release version*, *commit hash* or *branch name* -> *commit hash*.

To ensure stable versioning for the images, the versions in the `Dockerfiles` are alway pinned
to a stable release number or commit hash. The branch names are listed here for convenience.

| Extension | Version | `sddi-base` | `sddi` | `sddi-social` | Description |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| [`scheming`](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-scheming) | `0dda2be` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Configure and share CKAN dataset metadata forms. |
| [`hierarchy`](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-hierarchy) | `v1.2.0` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Allows to organize organizations and groups in a hierarchy tree (nested groups/orgs). |
| [`grouphierarchysddi`](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckanext-grouphierarchy-sddi) | `spatial-search` -> `63289a8` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Extends `hierarchy` with pre-defined groups and topics of the SDDI concept. |
| [`relation`](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckanext-relation-sddi) | `1.0.0` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Enables to create and visualize different types of relations (*realated_to*, *depends_on*, *part_of*) between catalog entries. |
| [`spatial`](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial) | `v2.0.0` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Provides the ability to search for datasets according to a given spatial extent. |
| [`datesearch`](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-datesearch) | `a01061a` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Provides the ability to search for datasets according to a given time frame. The search includes all datasets, in which the time of validity overlaps in at least one second with the search time frame. |
| [`repeating`](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-repeating) | `f09ed71` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | This extension provides a way to store repeating fields in CKAN datasets, resources, organizations and groups. |
| [`composite`](https://github.com/EnviDat/ckanext-composite) | `1e6d7bb` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | The extension allows to store structured dataset metadata, single or multiple fields. Only one level of subfields is possible. The subfields can be basic text, date type or dropboxes. |
| [`restricted`](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-restricted) | `02e7e14` |  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | CKAN extension to restrict the accessibility to the resources of a dataset. This way the package metadata is accesible but not the data itself (resource). The resource access restriction level can be individualy defined for every package. |
| [`dcat`](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat) | `v1.4.0` |  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Allow CKAN to expose and consume metadata from other catalogs using RDF documents serialized using DCAT. |
| [`geoview`](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-geoview) | `v0.0.20` |  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | This extension contains view plugins to display geospatial files and services in CKAN. |
| [`disqus`](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-disqus) |  |  |  | :heavy_check_mark: | The Disqus extension allows site visitors to comment on individual packages using an AJAX-based commenting system. The downsides of this plugin are that comments are not stored locally and user information is not shared between CKAN and the commenting system. |

## :rocket: Usage

The images provided in this repo are designed for the
[`sddi-ckan-k8s`](https://github.com/tum-gis/sddi-ckan-k8s) Helm chart. Go to the Helm chart repository
to find examples an how to run the images.

## :book: Configuration an documentation

The configuration of the Docker images is mainly done using environment variables using the
naming convention of [`ckanext-envvars`](https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-envvars).
Refer to the documentation of [`ckan`](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html)

## :handshake: Thanks

- This repo is based on the CKAN
  [Docker images](https://github.com/keitaroinc/docker-ckan) of
  [Keitaro](https://github.com/keitaroinc). Many thank's for your great work!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Build images

- Switch to the image folder, e.g. `cd sddi-base`
- Run `./build.sh` to the image. Run `./build.sh 2.9.7` to build* using
  a specific CKAN version.
- Use `./build-push.sh` to build and push the image.
